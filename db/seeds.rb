# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake dbseed (or created alongside the db with dbsetup).
#
# Examples
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name 'Chicago' }, { name 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name 'Emanuel', city cities.first)
